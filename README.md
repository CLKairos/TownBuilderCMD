# TownBuilderCMD
&it; Command Line game I made from scratch using C++
&it; I primarily used this project to help me get to know C++ better but I decided to share it out for the whole world to see.

This game features events that can occur before a turn such as, rival towns starting wars on yours, deadily plagues, and forest fires. You start out with $1000 and a dream, to make the most stable town ever.
